# Castle-Defense

Castle defense will be a moderate version of strategy video games of the subgenre Tower Defense(TD). In this game the aim is to defend the player's territories, so that the wave of the enemies can not pass through the gate. In each level a different wave of enemies will pass through a road where castles will be built around it. As the player passes more levels the wave increases its number of attackers making it harder for the castles to destroy the enemies. Each enemy destroyed gives the player a certain number of points and coins. The player uses the coins so she/he can buy castles. There are a variety of castles that the user can buy. Every type of castle has its own price and differs from the others by its strength and bomb types it shoots. After buying the castle, it is built in a certain place the player picks so it can defend the territory. Whenever an enemy manages to pass through the gate, the player loses some points. In order to reach the next level, the player should not let through the gate more than 5 enemies. If more than 5 enemies pass the gates, the player loses the game.
